Warm Up:
Write an “I’m thinking of a number” game. Have the computer pick a random number between 1 and 100. Make the user keep picking numbers until they guess right. If they’re wrong, tell them higher or lower. If they’re right, congratulate them, and end the program.

Practice 0!
Write a program that prints out each character in the String “Hello, world!” On a separate line.

Practice 1:
Suppose we have a Point of Sale, where we get the total value of goods the customer has purchased, as well as a customer type. We’ll want to get from the user…
1) Total Balance
2) Customer type (‘e’ employee, ‘r’ regular, ’t’ tax-exempt)
After you get those values, calculate sales tax, if any, and print out the Balance (possibly after discount), tax, and total due.

This Exercises: Scanner, If/Else, Variables, Expressions 

Practice 2:
Write a method that tests the equality of two arrays. If each value in each spot of the array are equal, return True.

This Exercises: If/Else, Methods, Arrays, Loops

Practice 3:
Write a program that finds the common elements between two arrays, and puts them in a third array. HINT: This involves nested loops. For each element in array1, you’ll have to compare it to each element in array2.

This Exercises: Loops, Arrays, If/Else, Nested Logic

Practice 4:
Use (probably two) nested for loops to draw an hour glass.

This Exercises: Nested Loops
